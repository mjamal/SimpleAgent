# AI Agent Instructions for SimpleAgent

This document provides essential guidance for AI agents working in the SimpleAgent codebase.

## Project Overview

SimpleAgent is a Python project in its initial stages of development. The project structure is currently minimal, consisting of:
- `FirstAgent.py`: Main agent implementation file
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## Development Environment

### Python Setup
- This is a Python project
- Before making any changes, ensure the Python environment is properly configured
- Use the project's virtual environment if one exists, or help create one if needed

## Project Structure Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Main agent logic should be implemented in `FirstAgent.py`
- Keep classes and functions focused on single responsibilities
- Document public interfaces with docstrings

### Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for class names (e.g., `SimpleAgent`)
- Use snake_case for functions and variables
- Prefix private methods and variables with underscore

## Best Practices

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code style
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Include descriptive docstrings for all public classes and methods

### Version Control
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Create new branches for feature development

## Note to AI Agents

This is a new project in its early stages. When contributing:
1. Help establish good practices early
2. Document design decisions and rationale
3. Suggest improvements to project structure as it grows
4. Keep code quality high from the start
